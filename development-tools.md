# Robotics 개발 툴

로보틱스 개발툴에 대해 알아봅니다. 

### Gazebo
Robust physics engine, high-quality graphics, and programmatic and graphical interfaces to help developers simulate robots

[Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/home) offers the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments.

### Rviz

- Rvis is a 3D Visulizer for the ROS framework. It provides information on the robot state and world around it (virtual or real).

- Rviz is a 3D visualization tool for ROS. It provides information on the robot state and world around it (virtual or real). You can use this tool to see sensor outputs (like camera feeds and the robot's current location on map), analyze your URDF models, set custom robot configurations and more. To visualize your robot sensors and map, we first need to point to our robot components.

### Rqt

- Rqt is an extensible dashboard framework that implements the various GUI tools and dashboards in the form of plugins for your robot applications.

### Colcon

- Colcon is a command line tool built by the OSRF(Open Source Robotics Foundation). It is a command line toool to improve the workflow of building, testing and using multiple software packages. It automates the building and bundling of ROS and ROS2 applications.


## 용어 

### Automated Guided Vehicles
- Follows pre-determined routes using physical guidance mechanisms
- Requires hardware guide changes to adapt to changing environments
- Stops when facing obstacles until removed
- Fixed depots for pickup and drop-off

### AMR

AMR(Autonomous Mobile Robots)의 특징은 아래와 같습니다. 

- Self determined routes to destination
- Ability to easily adapt to changing environments
- Can change path to navigates around obstacles 
- Dynamic pickup and drop-off locations
